# Language Portfolio Repository - Welcome

In here you will find the scripts for each of the class assignments I chose for the portfolio - the self chosen project resides in a different repository. 

In each assignment folder you will find clear instructions as to how to create virtual environments and run each script from the command line. 
I recommend cloning this entire repository.

The methods used for each assignment as well as a description of the results can be found in the Portfolio pdf.
